<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As part of the job application process for a company called SovTech, I was tasked to create a full-stack application using javascript libraries and frameworks.

At the moment, I am skillful with .NET Core and C#. I am relatively new when it comes to React or GraphQL. This project required me to use NodeJS (LTS), React (LTS), and TypeScript. It took me two nights to complete this task. It is not perfect and has some flaws, but for someone who had never worked with GraphQL before or made a full-stack react app, I am hoping that this project shows how fast I can pick up new technologies and make them work. I love modern javascript and am making an effort to keep learning it after work, where I usually only work with .NET Core and C#.

### Built With
Back-end:
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [ESlint](https://eslint.org/)

Front-end
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
* [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [ESlint](https://eslint.org/)
* [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
* [UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)
* [Apollo Client GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Shuaib121/SwapiApi.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages on both the Server and Client projects.
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
4. Make sure you change the url in the Client project which is located in App.tsx.
   ```JS
   uri: "enter server url here (example: http://localhost:4000/)",
   ```
### Cloud
1. Run the server in CodeSandBox (NOTE: THIS MUST BE DONE IN ORDER FOR THE CLIENT TO WORK)
   https://codesandbox.io/s/swapiserver-409us?file=/src/datasource.ts
2. Run the client in CodeSandBox (NOTE: If it is not loading the data, then either the api request is really slow or you need to update the url in App.tsx with url from the     server CodeSandBox above:
   https://codesandbox.io/s/swapiclient-uzsge



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

I have taken some screenshots and videos using the application.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

There is a lot that can be improved on with this project, such as caching and the way data is loaded into the table. Also, I feel like the client folder structure is a bit bloated, and it can probably be broken down into smaller components. Nevertheless, this was a tech assessment, and I was trying to get this done as soon as possible without prior GrapQL or full-stack javascript experience. I am hoping that this showcases my ability to learn and pick up new technologies reasonably quickly, as this was built within two nights.
